# OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) 

OpenCV is a powerful open-source computer vision and machine learning library. 

It was first released in 1999 and has since become one of the most widely used computer vision libraries. With its robust set of tools and functions, OpenCV enables us to perform various tasks related to image and video processing, including object detection, image recognition, and image manipulation.

Here are the top 20 functions that are widely used in OpenCV for image processing:

        1.imread(): This function is used to read an image from a file and store it in a matrix.
        
        2.imshow(): This function is used to display an image in a window.

        3.cvtColor(): This function is used to convert the color space of an image.

        4.GaussianBlur(): This function is used to apply a Gaussian blur to an image.

        5.Canny(): This function is used to detect edges in an image using the Canny edge detection algorithm.

        6.HoughLines(): This function is used to detect lines in an image using the Hough line transform.

        7.findContours(): This function is used to find contours in an image.

        8.drawContours(): This function is used to draw contours on an image.

        9.inRange(): This function is used to threshold an image based on a range of values.

        10.resize(): This function is used to resize an image.

        11.flip(): This function is used to flip an image along a vertical or horizontal axis.

        12.split(): This function is used to split an image into its RGB channels.

        13.merge(): This function is used to merge multiple images into a single image.

        14.addWeighted(): This function is used to blend two images using a weighted sum.

        15.threshold(): This function is used to threshold an image based on a threshold value.

        16.morphologyEx(): This function is used to perform morphological transformations on an image.

        17.erode(): This function is used to erode an image.

        18.dilate(): This function is used to dilate an image.

        19.Laplacian(): This function is used to apply a Laplacian filter to an image.

        20.Sobel(): This function is used to apply a Sobel filter to an image.

These functions are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the capabilities of OpenCV. With its extensive documentation and community support, it's no wonder why OpenCV is a go-to library for many computer vision projects. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced computer vision developer, OpenCV has something to offer for everyone.
